Requirements Engineering:The process of establishing the services that software will provide the customers and the constraints under it will be develped or operated.

**Types of requirements:
1.User requirements:Statements in natural language of users plus diagram 
2.System requirements:A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system's functions, services and operational constraints(contact between client and developer)

**Software Specification: A detailed software description which can serve as a basis for a design or implementation which is needed for developers.


**Software requirement is a field within software engineering that deals with establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software.
